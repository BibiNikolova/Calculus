Congratulations. You've
finished week 1. This week you'll learn
what a derivative is, how to calculate them, how to use them for optimization
and most importantly, how this optimization problem is translated to machine
learning problems. However, everything you've done so far is in one variable. As you may imagine, large machine-learning
problems use lots and lots of variables. That's what you're
going to learn next, how to do all this
derivative stuff but in more variables.
See you in week 2.
